**Performed an in-depth country-level analysis of over 180,000 terrorism incidents using the Global Terrorism Database. Built a custom K-Means clustering pipeline to classify countries based on attack frequency, fatalities, and injuries, uncovering high-risk regions and emerging threat patterns. Delivered actionable insights through intuitive visualizations, empowering policymakers and security agencies to prioritize resource allocation and develop targeted counterterrorism strategies.**

**We used K-Means because we wanted to group countries by similarity in terrorism metrics without predefined labels, which is exactly what clustering is for.**

**These insights can assist policymakers, analysts, and researchers in making data-informed decisions related to global security and counter-terrorism efforts.**
